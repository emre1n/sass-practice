# Sass Practice Project

Welcome to the Sass Practice Project! This repository is designed to help you become familiar with the powerful CSS preprocessor, Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets). In this project, you'll explore various Sass features and best practices to improve your front-end development skills.

## Getting Started

Before you dive into the project, make sure you have Sass installed on your system. If you haven't installed Sass, you can do so by following the instructions in the [official documentation](https://sass-lang.com/install).

To start working with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emre1n/sass-practice.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sass-practice
   ```

3. Compile the Sass code to CSS using the following command:

   ```bash
   sass --watch sass/main.scss:css/main.css
   ```

   This command will continuously watch for changes in your Sass code and compile it into CSS.

4. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the project in action.

## Project Structure

This project is organized as follows:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that serves as the foundation of your web page.

- **sass/main.scss**: This is where you will write your Sass code. You can explore various Sass features and techniques in this file.

- **css/main.css**: The compiled CSS file generated from your Sass code. This is the file linked to the HTML.

## Sass Features to Explore

In this project, you can practice and experiment with various Sass features, including but not limited to:

1. **Variables**: Define and use variables to store reusable values.

2. **Nesting**: Nest your CSS rules to make your code more structured and maintainable.

3. **Mixins**: Create and use mixins for reusable sets of CSS properties.

4. **Partials**: Break your Sass code into separate partial files for better organization and import them where needed.

5. **Functions**: Write custom functions to perform calculations or manipulate values.

6. **Control Directives**: Utilize control directives like `@if`, `@for`, and `@each` to create dynamic styles.

7. **Operators**: Use mathematical and logical operators for more complex calculations.

8. **Imports**: Import external libraries or Sass files to use their styles.

9. **Extend/Inheritance**: Share styles between selectors using `@extend`.

10. **Comments**: Add comments to your code for documentation and clarity.
